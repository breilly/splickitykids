We reserve the right to update the TOS from time-to-time at Our sole discretion. You hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p>BY USING THIS SITE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TOS, THE PRIVACY POLICY AND, AS APPLICABLE, THE PURCHASING AGREEMENTAND/OR THE REGISTRATION SERVICES AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, THE "USER AGREEMENTS"), EACH OF WHICH ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE, AND EXPRESSLY AGREE TO, AND CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY, ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED THEREIN. THE TOS SHALL HAVE THE SAME LEGAL EFFECT AND FORCE AS A WRITTEN AND SIGNED DOCUMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST CEASE USING THIS SITE. ANY VIOLATION OF THE TOS CAN RESULT IN ACTIONS BY US INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS AND RIGHT TO USE THE SITE, CANCELLATION OF YOUR ACTIVITY ORDER, AND/OR REMOVAL OF YOUR ACTIVITY LISTING.</p>
<h2>LICENSE</h2>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the User Agreements and Your compliance with their terms, We agree to provide You with access and use of Our Site while you are in compliance with the User Agreements and all other terms and conditions described for use of the Site, either as a party organizing and producing an activity (“Vendor”) or as a party who is registering a child for an activity (“Family”). There is no fee paid by You for basic access to Our Site, although We charge Vendors, which You may be, for Our registration services that We provide pursuant to Our Purchasing Agreement and Registration Services Agreement. Your access to the Site is provided pursuant to a free, limited, non-exclusive, and revocable license provided by Us.</p>
<h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
<p>You understand and agree that the Site may, at times, be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, but not limited to: (i) equipment or communications malfunctions; (ii) periodic maintenance, repairs, or administrative reviews which We may undertake from time-to-time; or (iii) causes beyond Our control or which are not reasonably foreseeable by Us. Our Site is offered as-is, and as-available. While We will make efforts to maintain the Site, We have no control over Your ability to access the Site at any particular time and We are not responsible for any limitation of services due to technical difficulties beyond Our control, including any interruption of service in providing the Site.</p>
<h2>EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p>You shall be solely responsible for providing, maintaining, and ensuring compatibility with the Site, all hardware, software, electrical, and other physical requirements for Your use of Our Site, including, but not limited to, telecommunications and internet access connections and links, web browsers or other equipment, and programs or services required to access and use the Site.</p>
<h2>PAYMENTS & REFUNDS</h2>
<p>To the extent You make or collect any payment of money using the Our Site, such payments will be transacted through Stripe, a third party facilitated payment method (“FPM"). When using an FPM, Organizers and Attendees effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service as promulgated by the applicable FPM service provider.</p>
<p>As per Our refund policy it is the responsibility of the Activities Vendor to communicate its refund policy to Families and to issue refunds to Families via the Site or otherwise. If a Family desires to request a refund or otherwise dispute a payment, the Family must do so by communicating with the Activities Vendor, and not Us, to resolve the matter. All communications or disputes regarding payments, chargebacks, and refunds are between the Organizer and Attendee exclusively, and We will not be responsible or liable in any way for payments, refunds, chargebacks, or error therein or failure thereof in connection with the use of any FPM.</p>
<p>Organizers must collect all monies directly from Attendees if using FPM. By using the FPM option, Activities Vendors agree to (i) pay splickity all then-applicable splickity service fees and any other fees and charges of any kind payable by You to splickity in connection with the provision of the Services (collectively, "Service Fees"), which payments shall be due and payable upon receipt of the invoice setting forth such charges; and (ii) accept the responsibility for providing refunds, less 10% splickity service fees, to Families at Your own discretion. splickity will not be responsible or liable for, and an Activities Vendor hereby agrees to fully indemnify splickity and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the FPM option. Invoices are sent monthly for Service Fees incurred in the previous month.</p>
<p>When an Activities Vendor elects to use Stripe for the collection of fees, payment processing occurs directly through Eventjoy. Under this FPM option, Eventjoy will collect all event fees on behalf of the Activities Vendor from Families and deduct all applicable splickity service fees from the fees collected by splickity and then pass the remainder along to the Activities Vendor within five (5) business days after the applicable event end date (either by mailing a check or through an electronic funds transfer, to the Activities Vendor address or account, respectively, that the Activities Vendor accurately designates on the Site), provided that splickity reserves the right to withhold funds (i) at any time as splickity determines to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, and other discrepancies; and (ii) as otherwise permitted pursuant to the User Agreements. splickity, in its sole discretion, may determine to advance a portion of collected fees to Activities Vendor prior to the period set forth above, on such terms and conditions as splickity may establish from time to time. Organizer agrees that all fees for a given event are earned by Activities Vendor only following conclusion of the applicable activity and all fees ultimately due will be net of all splickityy fees, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and other deductions, whether due to customer complaints, allegations of fraud, discrepancies related to the applicable event or otherwise. No payments will be made to an Activities Vendor from splickity with respect to any event that is cancelled. If payments have already been made by splickityy to an Activities Vendor for a cancelled event, such Activities Vendor will immediately refund to splickity all such payments upon cancellation of such activity. All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars, or other foreign currencies accepted by splickity. If Activities Vendor elects to list Activities Registration Fees in a foreign currency accepted by splickityy, splickityy will collect and disperse the funds in the foreign currency selected by Activities Vendor.</p>
<p>ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ANY PAYMENT BY SPLICKITY OF ACTIVITIES REGISTRATION FEES PRIOR TO THE FIFTH (5TH) BUSINESS DAY AFTER THE ONSET OF THE FIRST SESSION IN AN ACTIVITY SERIES ARE MERELY ADVANCES OF AMOUNTS THAT MAY BECOME DUE TO ACTIVITIES VENDOR HEREUNDER AND THAT SPLICKITY MAY DEMAND SUCH ADVANCES BACK (FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION), AND ACTIVITIES VENDOR SHALL THEREUPON PROMPTLY (AND IN ANY CASE WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER SUCH DEMAND) PAY BACK TO SPLICKITY SUCH ADVANCE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF DEMANDED BY SPLICKITY.</p>
<p>Under the CCP option, it is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Attendees and to issue refunds to Attendees via the Site. An Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of these User Agreements and the payment and refund mechanics of the Site. The Site permits an Organizer to issue refunds to Attendees, provided the refund is issued by Organizer before ninety-six (96) hours after the end date of an event and within six (6) months after the transaction date for the underlying ticket purchase. Refunds issued following such period will not be processed through the Site, unless otherwise agreed to by Eventjoy in its sole discretion. Subject to the foregoing, refunds issued by an Organizer will be processed within thirty (30) days after Organizer instructs the issuance of the refunds via the Site. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Attendee, and Eventjoy will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Eventjoy and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the CCP option.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, You acknowledge and agree that splickity shall have the right to force a refund of any or all activities at any time for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if splickity receives complaints from a substantial number (as determined by splickity in its sole discretion) of Families with respect to the applicable activity or another activity held by Activities Vendor, or splickity determines in its sole discretion that Activities Vendor has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations. Further, if a Family requests a refund, whether due to a cancelled event or for any other reason where splickity would reasonably expect to lose a chargeback, splickity may, in its sole discretion, issue such refund to such Family, and Activities Vendor shall then owe the amount of such refund to splickity.</p>

<p>Under the Gateway option, any credit card chargebacks initiated by an Attendee for any reason with respect to an event shall be charged back to the Organizer of such event. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between the Organizer and Attendee, and Eventjoy will not be responsible or liable in any way for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Eventjoy and its affiliates for, chargebacks issued in the course of the use of the Gateway option.</p>
<h2>PAYMENTS & REMEDIES</h2>
<p>In the event that Activities Vendor fails to pay to splickity any amount owed pursuant to these User Agreements when due, such amount shall bear interest calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) ten percent (10%) per annum, and (b) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In the event any amounts are owed by Activities Vendor to splickity under these User Agreements or otherwise, splickity may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, (i) deduct such amounts from Activity Vendor's outstanding balance, whether for that particular activity or for any other activity that Activity Vendor lists through the Services; and (ii) send an invoice to Activity Vendor for such amounts to the extent Activity Vendor's outstanding balance is insufficient to cover these costs, in which case Activity Vendor shall pay splickity such invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. If payment for any amounts due to Splickity hereunder are not made by Activity Vendor when due, splickity reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, to terminate Activity Vendor's registration for the Services (including any and all accounts that Activity Vendor may have) and to cancel all other activities listed by Activity Vendor.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual ticket purchase, Eventjoy generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number. Organizers agree to unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all ticketing commitments that have been confirmed by Eventjoy through the Services, and it is Your responsibility to verify the Attendee's membership status, confirmation number and any event restrictions prior to the subject event.</p>
<p>Activities Vendors are solely responsible for determining which, if any, sales, use, amusement, value added, consumption, excise and other taxes, duties, levies and charges (collectively, "Taxes") apply to Your use of the Services and for collecting, remitting and reporting the correct amounts of all such Taxes to the applicable governmental authorities, even if splickity provides You with tools that assist You in doing so. splickity does not represent or warrant that any tax tools will meet all tax requirements that may be applicable to You. splickity cannot give You legal or tax advice, so please be sure to check with Your own tax advisor about any applicable Taxes. In the event that a governmental authority requires splickity to pay any Taxes attributable to Your use of the Services, You agree to indemnify and reimburse splickity for such Taxes and all costs and expenses related thereto.</p>
<p>Fees charged by splickity do not include any Taxes except to the extent that a Tax is expressly set forth in the applicable invoice or billing statement, and You shall pay any Taxes that are imposed and payable on such Service Fees (other than those calculated based on splickity's net income) to splickity.</p>
<p>In addition, due to new IRS regulations, if splickity processes transactions and issues You payouts (A) for more than $20,000 in gross sales and (B) for more than 200 order transactions, in each case during a given calendar year and in the aggregate across all of Your accounts, splickity is required to report to the IRS the gross amount of transactions for which You have been paid in that calendar year and in each month of that calendar year, as well as Your name, your address, and your Tax Identification Number ("Your Tax Information"). As part of these new IRS regulations, splickity is required to either (I) collect Your Tax Information or (II) establish that You are a foreign person not subject to U.S. taxes, before Your accounts pass the 200 order transaction threshold in the aggregate. Once Your accounts cross the 200 order transaction threshold, You agree that you will not receive any further payments from splickity until either (I) or (II) above are satisfied.
splickity reserves the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to You hereunder if splickity suspects or determines that such amounts have been generated in (A) a fraudulent manner, (B) violation of these User Agreements, or (C) violation of any applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic), or if splickity is required to do so by applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic). Such withholding may be temporary or permanent (as determined by splickity).</p>
